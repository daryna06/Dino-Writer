# Dino-Writer 
The pomodoro timer with a fun surprise!

## Inspiration
We can lose focus when working on large assignments, especially English papers, essays or reports. Although many writing productivity or Pomodoro tools, we felt that they never made the user accountable for their goals. Most applications never have a system for checking if the user completed the task. Also, one common problem we saw was the lack of control over the break time. The rewards systems heavily depend on the user staying honest to the break time. 

## What it does

Although Dino Writer is simple, it can help anyone accomplish a lot. First, the user inputs a word count goal that they want to achieve. Afterwards, the user can customize their break time to suit their needs better. Our web app also has a text area that automatically calculates the word count. Once the user reaches their goal, a game will pop out and close after break time. We decided to use the popular yet simple dino game since it is beloved by all and was beginner-friendly to make. 

## How we built it

Since both of us are beginners, we used Reply to collaborate and make the whole web app. Even though we had little previous experience of HTML, CSS and javascript, it was a great learning experience. 

## Challenges we ran into

As we are beginners, we had some challenges formatting the website and making the game, timer, and word counter work. We also had bugs throughout the hackathon but were able to do more research and fix any problems. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Both of us started from a place with limited knowledge of any coding languages and experience. However, we are very proud of learning and improving ourselves in the spirit of the competition. We are both very proud of how far we came in such a small time frame and very proud of Dino Writer as a whole.

## What we learned

Since both of us are new to hackathons, we learned more about collaborating on your projects and ideas. We also further improved our CSS, HTML, and javascript skills and learned more about debugging our code and efficiently fixing any errors.  

## What's next for Dino Writer
We plan on innovating and improving Dino Writer, constantly improving this project over time. There are plans to make an extension for this game and a version that teaches other people how to make code, furthering the project. This project will go through constant development and continually improve over time to be at its best.
